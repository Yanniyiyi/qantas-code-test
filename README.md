# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Demo Link
Open [Demo link in Vercel](https://qantas-code-test-tkwzy4pzr-yanniyiyi.vercel.app/) to view it in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run e2e`

**Note: As msw.js doesn't work well with Firefox, so firefox has been removed from e2e target browsers, could be fixed later**

Launches the e2e test runner. e2e test is using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## Approach

Split the UI to small components and try to make them reusable and Tailwind.css allows me to create a good layout easily.

Due to time limitations, there are some things that could be improved:
- no common layout components 
- components could be polished
- tests cover most basic scenarios but more tests could be added
- accessibility could be imporved
